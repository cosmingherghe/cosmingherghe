## About Me:
#### I have always been passionate about computers, both the hardware and the software, however personal circumstances early in my career forced me to pursue employment in other areas. The financial stability offered by my current role has allowed me to pursue my interest for IT and to further develop my existing knowledge. I have actively done this by using my spare time for online courses on eLearning sites, such us Udemy, getting up to date with current best practices and reading software development 📚 books; all with the aim of switching careers.

🤔 I’m looking for help in securing a position as a software developer.
